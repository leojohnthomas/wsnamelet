	* wsname_applet.py: Added a fixed width mode, and a preferences dialog to configure the width. Made pressing the escape key cancel out of editing the name. Fixed menu to use accelerators and stock icons.

	* configure.in: bumped version to 0.9.0, since it is perfectly bug free and should therefore be ready for beta now.

	* wsname_applet.py(WSNameEntryWindow): Move workspace name changing from entry changed signal to activate signal, which fixes nastiness where the entry would briefly be blank, causing the previous workspace name to be lost.
	
	* configure.in: bumped version to 0.1.0, on account of the fix makeing the applet usable.

	* GNOME_WorkspaceNameApplet.server.in.in, Makefile.am, wsnamelet.png: added icon. 

	* wsname_applet.py (WSNameEntryWindow._onActivate): Toggle button (and hide entry window) when enter is pressed.
	(WSNameApplet._onToggled): disable tooltips while entry is shown (because the tooltip ends up obscuring the entry, which is annoying.)
