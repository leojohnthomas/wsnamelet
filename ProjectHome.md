A gnome panel applet that displays and allows you to edit the name of the current workspace.

To change the name of the current workspace, simply click on the applet, type the new name, and press Enter.

This is particularly useful for people who use a lot of workspaces and switch between them frequently. The gnome workspace switcher applet will show the names of workspaces, but changing them requires going into the preferences, which takes too many clicks for frequent use.
